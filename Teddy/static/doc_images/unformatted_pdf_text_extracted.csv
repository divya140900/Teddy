Short stories
INTRODUCTION
A short story is a prose narrative of limited length.
It organises the action and thoughts of itscharacters into the pattern of a plot. The plotform may be comic, tragic, romantic or satiric.The central incident is selected to manifest, asmuch as possible, the protagonist’s life andcharacter , and the details contribute to the
development of the plot.
The term ‘short story’ covers a great diversity of
prose fiction, right from the really short ‘shortstory’ of about five hundred words to longer andmore complex works. The longer ones, with theirstatus of middle length, fall between the tautnessof the short narrative and the expansiveness ofthe novel.
There can be thematic variation too. The stories
deal with fantasy, reality, alienation and theproblem of choice in personal life. There are threeshort stories and two long ones in this sectionrepresenting writers from five cultures.

Gabriel Garcia Marquez was brought up by his
grandparents in Northern Columbia because hisparents were poor and struggling. A novelist, short-story writer and journalist, he is widely consideredthe greatest living Latin American master of narrative.Marquez won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1982.His two masterpieces ar e One Hundr ed Y ears in
Solitude (1967, tr . 1970) and Love in The T ime of
Cholera (1985, tr . 1988). His themes ar e violence,
solitude and the overwhelming human need for love.This story reflects, like most of his works, a highpoint in Latin American magical realism; it is richand lucid, mixing reality with fantasy.
One morning  at nine o’clock, while we were having breakfast
on the terrace of the Havana Riviera Hotel under a brightsun, a huge wave picked up several cars that were drivingdown the avenue along the seawall or parked on thepavement, and embedded one of them in the side of thehotel. It was like an explosion of dynamite that sowed panicon all twenty floors of the building and turned the greatentrance window to dust. The many tourists in the lobbywere thrown into the air along with the furniture, andsome were cut by the hailstorm of glass. The wave musthave been immense, because it leaped over the wide two-way street between the seawall and the hotel and still hadenough force to shatter the window.
The cheerful Cuban volunteers, with the help of the
fire department, picked up the debris in less than six hours,and sealed of f the gate to the sea and installed another ,

and everything returned to normal. During the morning
nobody worried about the car encrusted in the wall, forpeople assumed it was one of those that had been parkedon the pavement. But when the crane lifted it out of itssetting, the body of a woman was found secured behindthe steering wheel by a seat belt. The blow had been sobrutal that not a single one of her bones was left whole.Her face was destroyed, her boots had been ripped apart,and her clothes were in shreds. She wore a gold ring shapedlike a serpent, with emerald eyes. The police establishedthat she was the housekeeper for the new Portugueseambassador and his wife. She had come to Havana withthem two weeks before and had left that morning for themarket, driving a new car. Her name meant nothing to mewhen I read it in the newspaper , but I was intrigued by the
snake ring and its emerald eyes. I could not find out,however , on which finger she wor e it.
This was a crucial piece of information, because I feared
she was an unforgettable woman whose real name I neverknew, and who wore a similar ring on her right forefingerwhich, in those days, was even more unusual than it isnow. I had met her thirty-four years earlier in Vienna,eating sausage with boiled potatoes and drinking draft beerin a tavern frequented by Latin American students. I hadcome from Rome that morning, and I still remember myimmediate response to her splendid soprano’s bosom, thelanguid foxtails on her coat collar, and that Egyptian ringin the shape of a serpent. She spoke an elementary Spanishin a metallic accent without pausing for breath, and Ithought she was the only Austrian at the long woodentable. But no, she had been born in Colombia and hadcome to Austria between the wars, when she was littlemore than a child, to study music and voice. She wasabout thirty, and did not carry her years well, for she hadnever been pretty and had begun to age before her time.But she was a charming human being. And one of themost awe-inspiring.
Vienna was still an old imperial city, whose
geographical position between the two irreconcilable worldsleft behind by the Second W orld W ar had turned it into a

paradise of black marketeering and international espionage.
I could not have imagined a more suitable spot for myfugitive compatriot, who still ate in the students’ tavernon the corner only out of loyalty to her origins, since shehad more than enough money to buy meals for all hertable companions. She never told her real name, and wealways knew her by the Germanic tongue twister that weLatin American students in Vienna invented for her: FrauFrieda. I had just been introduced to her when I committedthe happy impertinence of asking how she had come to bein a world so distant and different from the windy cliffs ofQuindio, and she answered with a devastating:
‘I sell my dreams.’In reality, that was her only trade. She had been the
third of eleven children born to a prosperous shopkeeperin old Caldas, and as soon as she learned to speak sheinstituted the fine custom in her family of telling dreamsbefore breakfast, the time when their oracular qualitiesare preserved in their purest form. When she was sevenshe dreamed that one of her brothers was carried off by aflood. Her mother, out of sheer religious superstition,forbade the boy to swim in the ravine, which was hisfavourite pastime. But Frau Frieda already had her ownsystem of prophecy.
‘What that dream means,’ she said, ‘isn’t that he’s
going to drown, but that he shouldn’t eat sweets.’
Her interpretation seemed an infamy to a five-year -old
boy who could not live without his Sunday treats. Theirmother , convinced of her daughter’s oracular talents,
enforced the warning with an iron hand. But in her firstcareless moment the boy choked on a piece of caramel thathe was eating in secret, and there was no way to save him.
Frau Frieda did not think she could earn a living with
her talent until life caught her by the throat during thecruel Viennese winters. Then she looked for work at thefirst house where she would have liked to live, and whenshe was asked what she could do, she told only the truth:‘I dream.’ A brief explanation to the lady of the house wasall she needed, and she was hired at a salary that just

covered her minor expenses, but she had a nice room and
three meals a day—br eakfast in particular , when the family
sat down to learn the immediate future of each of itsmembers: the father , a r efined financier; the mother , a
joyful woman passionate about Romantic chamber music;and two children, eleven and nine years old. They were allreligious and therefore inclined to archaic superstitions,and they were delighted to take in Frau Frieda, whoseonly obligation was to decipher the family’s daily fatethrough her dreams.
She did her job well, and for a long time, above all
during the war years, when reality was more sinister thannightmares. Only she could decide at breakfast what eachshould do that day, and how it should be done, until herpredictions became the sole authority in the house. Hercontrol over the family was absolute: even the faintest sighwas br eathed by her or der. The master of the house died
at about the time I was in Vienna, and had the elegance toleave her a part of his estate on the condition that shecontinue dreaming for the family until her dreams cameto an end.
I stayed in Vienna for more than a month, sharing the
straitened circumstances of the other students while Iwaited for money that never arrived. Frau Frieda’sunexpected and generous visits to the tavern were likefiestas in our poverty-stricken regime. One night, in a beeryeuphoria, she whispered in my ear with a conviction thatpermitted no delay.
‘I only came to tell you that I dreamed about you last
night,’ she said. ‘Y ou must leave right away and not come
back to Vienna for five years.’
Her conviction was so real that I boarded the last train
to Rome that same night. As for me, I was so influenced bywhat she said that from then on I considered myself asurvivor of some catastrophe I never experienced. I stillhave not returned to Vienna.

Before the disaster in Havana, I had seen Frau Frieda
in Barcelona in so unexpected and fortuitous a way that itseemed a mystery to me. It happened on the day PabloNeruda stepped on Spanish soil for the first time since theCivil W ar, on a stopover during a long sea voyage to
Valparaiso. He spent a morning with us hunting big game
in the second-hand bookstores, and at Porter he boughtan old, dried-out volume with a torn binding for which hepaid what would have been his salary for two months atthe consulate in Rangoon. He moved through the crowdlike an invalid elephant, with a child’s curiosity in theinner workings of each thing he saw, for the world appearedto him as an immense wind-up toy with which life invented
itself.
I have never known anyone closer to the idea one has
of a Renaissance pope: He was gluttonous and refined.Even against his will, he always presided at the table.Matilde, his wife, would put a bib around his neck thatbelonged in a barbershop rather than a dining room, but itwas the only way to keep him from taking a bath in sauce.That day at Carvalleiras was typical. He ate three wholelobsters, dissecting them with a surgeon’s skill, and at thesame time devoured everyone else’s plate with his eyesand tasted a little from each with a delight that made thedesire to eat contagious: clams from Galicia, mussels fromCantabria, prawns from Alicante, sea cucumbers from theCosta Brava. In the meantime, like the French, he spokeof nothing but other culinary delicacies, in particular theprehistoric shellfish of Chile, which he carried in his heart.All at once he stopped eating, tuned his lobster’s antennae,and said to me in a very quiet voice:
‘There’s someone behind me who won’t stop looking at
me.’

I glanced over his shoulder , and it was true. Thr ee
tables away sat an intrepid woman in an old-fashioned
felt hat and a purple scarf, eating without haste and staringat him. I recognised her right away. She had grown oldand fat, but it was Frau Frieda, with the snake ring on herindex finger .
She was travelling from Naples on the same ship as
Neruda and his wife, but they had not seen each other onboar d. W e invited her to have cof fee at our table, and I
encouraged her to talk about her dreams in order to astoundthe poet. He paid no attention, for from the very beginninghe had announced that he did not believe in propheticdreams.
‘Only poetry is clairvoyant,’ he said.After lunch, during the inevitable stroll along the
Ramblas, I lagged behind with Frau Frieda so that we couldrenew our memories with no other ears listening. She toldme she had sold her properties in Austria and retired toOporto, in Portugal, where she lived in a house that shedescribed as a fake castle on a hill, from which one couldsee all the way across the ocean to the Americas. Althoughshe did not say so, her conversation made it clear that,dream by dream, she had taken over the entire fortune ofher ineffable patrons in Vienna. That did not surprise me,however, because I had always thought her dr eams wer e
no more than a stratagem for surviving. And I told her so.
She laughed her irresistible laugh. ‘Y ou’re as impudent
as ever ,’ she said. And said no mor e, because the r est of
the group had stopped to wait for Neruda to finish talkingin Chilean slang to the parrots along the Rambla de losPájaros. When we resumed our conversation, Frau Friedachanged the subject.
‘By the way,’ she said, ‘you can go back to Vienna
now.’
Only then did I realise that thirteen years had gone by
since our first meeting.
‘Even if your dreams are false, I’ll never go back,’ I told
her. ‘Just in case.’
At three o’clock we left her to accompany Neruda to his
sacred siesta, which he took in our house after solemn

preparations that in some way recalled the Japanese tea
ceremony. Some windows had to be opened and others closedto achieve the perfect degree of warmth, and there had tobe a certain kind of light from a certain direction, andabsolute silence. Neruda fell asleep right away, and woketen minutes later , as childr en do, when we least expected
it. He appeared in the living room refreshed, and with themonogram of the pillowcase imprinted on his cheek.
‘I dreamed about that woman who dreams,’ he said.Matilde wanted him to tell her his dream.‘I dreamed she was dreaming about me,’ he said.‘That’s right out of Borges,’ I said.He looked at me in disappointment.‘Has he written it already?’‘If he hasn’t he’ll write it sometime,’ I said. ‘It will be
one of his labyrinths.’
As soon as he boarded the ship at six that evening, Neruda
took his leave of us, sat down at an isolated table, and beganto write fluid verses in the green ink he used for drawingflowers and fish and birds when he dedicated his books. Atthe first ‘All ashore’ we looked for Frau Frieda, and found herat last on the tourist deck, just as we were about to leavewithout saying good-bye. She too had taken a siesta.
‘I dreamed about the poet,’ she said.In astonishment I asked her to tell me her dream.‘I dreamed he was dreaming about me,’ she said, and
my look of amazement disconcerted her. ‘What did youexpect? Sometimes, with all my dreams, one slips in thathas nothing to do with real life.’

ambassador when we happened to meet some monthslater at a diplomatic reception. The ambassador spokeabout her with great enthusiasm and enormousadmiration. ‘Y ou cannot imagine how extraor dinary she
was,’ he said. ‘You would have been obliged to write astory about her.’ And he went on in the same tone, withsurprising details, but without the clue that would haveallowed me to come to a final conclusion.
‘In concrete terms,’ I asked at last, ‘what did she do?’

The position of a word, phrase or an idea within a sentenceusually indicates the emphasis it receives. Generally, the most
emphatic place in the sentence is its  end;  the next most
emphatic is its beginning; and the least emphatic, its middle.
In the sentence above the most important fact is that the huge
wave embedded one of the cars in one side of the hotel.
The other details of time and place are given at the beginning.
The general statement of the ‘huge wave picking up several
cars’ precedes the particular car which is pertinent to the theme
of the story.
Let us rewrite th e sentence, beginning with ‘a huge wave’ and
the first part following ‘hotel’ and  notice the difference in the
effect.
A huge wave picked up several cars that were driving
